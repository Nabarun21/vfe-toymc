One need to choose a readout phase for each pulse.
Current ECAL tries to use a readout phase that places peak of the pulse at the 6th sample (out of 10)

Lets use similar approach to determine the readout phase for each pulse shape at three different samplings with 40 MHz, 80 MHz and 160 MHz. Lets call this approach "6th-12th-24th" which means that peak of the pulse is at
- 6th sample for 10 samples in the readout with 25ns steps
- 12th sample for 20 samples in the readout with 12ns steps
- 24th sample for 40 samples in the readout with 6ns steps


However, the are reasons to believe that for PU mitigation it is beneficial to adjust readout phase to provide more information about BX before in-time BX (BX0). One can study other scenarios like 
- "7th-14th-28th"
- "8th-16th-32th"
